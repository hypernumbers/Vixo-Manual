Saving Templates
================

Now that we’ve built the bug pages that will be used as a standard model for bug reporting and updates  and applied user group access permissions we’ll save them as templates.

We will illustrate this for the overview page and save it as a template called ``b_bug_overview``. To do this:

1. Open the ``Site`` and select the ``My Pages`` option
2. Select the page to be saved as a template i.e.``/bug/0000001/``
3. Enter the name to save the template as in the input field (in the highlighted area) as ``b_bug_overview``
4. Press ``Save As``

A dialog box will pop up asking for confirmation of the page being saved and the name for the template being saved.

If the details are correct click ``ok``. If not you can ``cancel`` and go back to amend any details.

We would follow the same steps for each page to be saved as a template. For this application the full list of templates saved are:

======================     ==================
Page                       Template name
======================     ==================
/bug/0000001/              b_bug_overview
/bug/0000001/opened/       b_bug_submit
/bug/0000001/dev/          b_bug_fix
/bug/0000001/test/         b_bug_test
