Navigation
==========

We should also consider how users will navigate around the system when it’s completed. From the page structure it’s easy to see that our  top level navigation menu should incorporate dashboard, bugs, bug-worklists and admin links. These top level links should then have sub-links to the pages if any below the top page.

We’ll also incorporate links from the bug-worklists page straight through to each bug.
