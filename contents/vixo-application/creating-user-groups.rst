Create User Groups
==================

Now that we’ve created the core bug pages around which our role based permissions will apply, we will set up our user groups.

Our main user groups have already been identified as:

* Users
* Developers
* Testers

To create these user groups  open the ``Views`` menu and go to the ``Groups`` tab:

You enter the usergroup name (here we are setting up the “Users” usergroup) and press the ``Create Group`` button. We then set up the “Developers” usergroup:

And finally we would set up the  “Testers” usergroup.

Although, you can set some views for the group when you create them this will only apply to the page you’re on when accessed the ``Views`` menu. For that reason we have only created the user groups here and will show how this is done in the Applying page and user group permissions section.
