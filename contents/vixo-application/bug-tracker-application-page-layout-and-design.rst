Page Layout and Design
======================

Lastly, it is also useful to have in mind a design layout for each of your pages. This can be done as a paper prototype and involves sketching each page’s layout and, if it helps how data flows between pages.

The layout we chose for each of the ``/bugs/…/`` pages is:

For the ``/bug-worklists/`` page:

And for the ``/dashboard/`` page:
