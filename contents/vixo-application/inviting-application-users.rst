Inviting Users
==============

Now that we’ve built the bug tracker the last thing left to do is to invite users to use it.

This done via the ``users`` tab in the ``Views`` menu.  We can see how it’s done by inviting Gordon, the founder of vixo, the guy who came up with the concept and CTO who led the development of the technology that made it possible to build this bug tracker.

You enter the email of the person to be invited, choose what group or groups they belong to, add a personal message and press the ``Create User`` button.
