Hypernumbers Social Media Functions
===================================

A number of functions ar available to integrate social media applications into hypernumbers applications. These include:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   FACEBOOK.COMMENTS   <facebook-comments>
   GENERIC.INTEGRATION <generic-integration>

Some of these functions are *sizable* that is to say they contain their size in the function call. A sizable function looks like:

``=function.3x6(arg1, arg2, ...)``

The expression ``.3x6`` on the end says *make me three cells wide and six cells high*. This just causes the cell that the function is called in to merge over that set of cells.
