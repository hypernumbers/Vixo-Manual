Introduction To Navigation Functions
====================================

A number of navigation function are available for use in building web applications including:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   html.menu.W <menu>
   html.submenu <submenu>
   link <link>
   page <page>
   site <site>
   crumb.trail <crumbtrail>
   segment <segment>
   pageurl <pageurl>

Some of these functions are *sizable* that is to say they contain their size in the function call. A sizable function looks like:

``=function.6(arg1, arg2, ...)``

The expression ``6`` on the end says *make me six cells wide. This just causes the cell that the function is called in to merge over that set of cells.
