When Should I Use Hypernumbers?
=======================

You should use Hypernumbers when you have:

* a task that you would like to automate but which you can't afford to
* business processes that are error prone because they rely on individuals collecting information by e-mail and phone and transcribing it into spreadsheet
* critical spreadsheets that are edited by multiple people with transcripton errors, overwriting and locking problems that entail from that
* information in spreadsheets in structured file systems that have complex manual protocols that staff members need to master before updating them
* data collation tasks that involve the repeated manual creation and emailing of reports or other critical information
