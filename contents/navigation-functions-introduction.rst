Introduction To Navigation Functions
====================================

A number of navigation function are available for use in building web applications including:

*	html.menu.W
*	html.submenu
*	link
*	page
*	site
*	crumb.trail
*	segment
*	pageurl

Some of these functions are *sizable* that is to say they contain their size in the function call. A sizable function looks like:

``=function.6(arg1, arg2, ...)``

The expression ``6`` on the end says *make me six cells wide. This just causes the cell that the function is called in to merge over that set of cells.
