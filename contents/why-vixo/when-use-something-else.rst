=================================
When Should I Use Something Else?
=================================

Vixo is not a panacea. There are times you need to use other tools.

If you need to process data for yourself and don't need to share it, then desktop spreadsheets like Excel and Open Office are excellent tools for the job.

If you need to crunch lots of data, 100,000's of rows of it, at high speed, you should use Excel or Open Office.

If you need the following spreadsheet functionality it is not supported in Vixo:

* pivot tables - use Excel, Open Office or Google Docs
* live integration with databases
* headers and footers and other printing-focussed features
* conditional formatting

.. index:: pivot tables; headers, footers, printing
   pair: formatting; conditional
   pair: live integration; databases
