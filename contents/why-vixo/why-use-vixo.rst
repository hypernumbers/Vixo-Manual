Why Use Vixo?
=============

Vixo is designed to allow ordinary spreadsheet users to build shared, rich web applications using their ordinary spreadsheet skills.

Spreadsheets are useful because they enable ordinary people to organise their work practices without needing to call in the techies.

But whilst **a spreadsheet is an elegant solution to a business problem, a thousand spreadsheets is simply a problem**.

Vixo believes that ordinary people need better web tools that enable them to get the most out of the internet.

Our mission is to make it easy for you, the ordinary business person who can use a spreadsheet, to build quick, cheap and custom applications that focus on your business and your needs without the need to spend a fortune on IT staff. These solutions should not proliferate uncontrolledly like desktop spreadsheets, but need to be managed in a control, coherent way to allow you to keep control of your business.
