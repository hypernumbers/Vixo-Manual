Managing Pages
--------------

Building up your application's page tree and other administrative activities are managed using the ``site`` menu - on the left of the toolbar. The ``site`` menu enables the spreadsheet expert to:

* open existing pages (in the spreadsheet view)
*	create new blank pages
* delete existing pages
*	navigate through the spreadsheet page structure
*	save a page as a template (incorporating view and user permissions)
*	create new pages using a saved template
*	import desktop spreadsheets into vixo
*	change a userâ€™s password

If you open the page dialog box you can also perform most of these functions using a right-click:
