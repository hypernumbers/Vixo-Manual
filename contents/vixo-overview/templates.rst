Templates
=========

In vixo, templates perform a very important role. They are essential application building blocks in situations where many instances of the templated page will be needed to capture data in a consistent way that doesnâ€™t mess up any calculation or business logic associated with the particular type of page.

Templates are preformatted pages that act as a model of a particular page that is used in an application. As an illustration we might consider the following as example templates in a finance application:

*	Invoices and timesheets
*	Budget templates
*	NI Calculators
*	Etc. etc.

In vixo, such pages can be saved as a template for repeated use. In terms of application security, pages that are saved as a template inherit all user access and operations permissions that have been applied to the page that has been saved as the template.

A special template function is available that enables template instantiation to be incorporated into the natural process or workflow of an applications web or wikipages.
