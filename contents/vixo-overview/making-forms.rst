Making Forms
------------

It is a trivial task to add webforms to a vixo page. Forms are created in the spreadsheet view and used to collect information via the webpage or wikipage views. There are two types of forms you can create:

* appending form
* wikiform

The appending form sticks the data straight into a table-formatted spreadsheet with columns of data and headers. You can then use the table view analyse and explore the submitted responses. Wikiforms are used to capture data into cells in a specific spreadsheet and are often used in conjuction with templates.

You can build a form in the spreadsheet view by using the toolbar form icons to add form controls to cells on the spreadsheet. A faster way is to highlight a range of cells and use the ``right-click`` menu (illustrated in the excel-like-spreadsheet diagram) to access the ``create forms`` option. A basic form is added to cells in the selected range. You can then change form elements and layout as required.

The example below shows an appending type webform as it appears in the spreadsheet and webpage views.

An example of a wikiform as it appears in the ``spreadsheet``, ``wikipage`` and ``webpage`` views is shown below:
