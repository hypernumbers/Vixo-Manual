Managing Your Application
-------------------------

Building up your application's page tree and other administrative activities are managed using the ``site`` menu - on the left of the toolbar. The ``site`` menu enables the application programmer (i.e. the spreadsheet expert) to:

*       Open existing pages (in the spreadsheet view)
*	Create new blank pages
*       Delete existing pages
*	Navigate through the spreadsheet page structure
*	Save a page as a template (incorporating view and user permissions)
*	Create new pages using a saved template
*	Import desktop spreadsheets into vixo
*	Change userâ€™s sign-on passwords
