ACOS
====

Overview
--------

Returns the inverse trigonometric cosine of a number.

Syntax
------

``=ACOS(Number)``

This function returns the inverse trigonometric cosine of Number, that is the angle (in radians) whose cosine is Number. The angle returned is between 0 and PI.

To return the angle in degrees, use the DEGREES function.

Example
-------

``=ACOS(-1)`` returns 3.14159265358979 (PI radians)

``=DEGREES(ACOS(0.5))`` returns 60. The cosine of 60 degrees is 0.5.
