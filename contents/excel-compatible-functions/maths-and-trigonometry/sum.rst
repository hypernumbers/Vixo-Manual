===

Overview
--------

Adds all the numbers in a range of cells.

Syntax
------

``=SUM(Number1, Number2...)``

SUM takes an infinite number of arguments whose sum is to be calculated.

Z-Order
-------

In Hypernumbers as well as taking normal row and column references, SUM can take z-references. See the section on Database Queries **add link/reference** for more details.

Example
-------

If you enter the numbers 2, 3 and 4 in the Number 1, 2 and 3 text boxes, 9 will be returned as the result.

``=SUM(A1,A3,B5)`` calculates the sum of the three cells. ``=SUM(A1:E10)`` calculates the sum of all cells in the A1 to E10 cell range.
