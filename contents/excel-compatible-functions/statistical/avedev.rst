Overview
--------

Returns the average of the absolute deviations of values from their mean.

Syntax
------

``=AVEDEV(number1, number2,...)``

    number1, number2, or a cell range can be input into this function. 

    AVEDEV calculates the mean of the numbers, then the absolute (positive signed) deviation of each number from that mean. It returns the average of those deviations. 

Example
-------

``=AVEDEV(1, 4, 7)`` returns 2. The mean is 4, and the absolute deviations from the mean are 3, 0, 3 respectively.
