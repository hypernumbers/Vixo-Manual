COUNT
=====

Overview
--------

Counts how many numbers are in the list of arguments. Text entries are ignored.

Syntax
------

``=COUNT(Value1, Value2...)``

Value1, Value... are an infinite number of values or ranges representing the values to be counted.

Example
-------

The entries 2, 4, 6 and eight in the Value 1-4 fields are to be counted.

``=COUNT(2,4,6,"eight")`` = 3. The count of numbers is therefore 3.
