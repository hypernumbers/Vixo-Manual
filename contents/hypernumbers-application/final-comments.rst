That’s that. A secure transactional web application incorporating:

* collaboration tools
* forms
* web navigation
*

And all built on the hypernumbers spreadsheet platform by someone who is not a programmer.

If you are thinking so what then you haven’t grasped the magnitude and significance of this feat.

Or you might thinking  that there are better  bug tracker software on the market. This is undoubtedly true but consider for a moment the cost , flexibility to change and other constraints that a bought software package might incur to you and your organisation. Integration and expansion for example.

You might say that much of this could be built in Excel. But only if you could program in VBA. And that’s the point. You don’t need to know any scripting language such as VBA to be able to build these sorts of applications in hypernumbers. It’s all down to an ever expanding array of functions that make it possible to program in the spreadsheet such that it works like a proper IT software application.

As to the size of the application. With the historical bugs loaded there are approximately 395 spreadsheet pages incorporating:

* 4 dashboard pages
* 2 admin pages
* 1 worklist page
* 97 (historical bugs) x 4 bug pages

It’s maybe not a large number, but when you can build applications with 10000+ spreadsheet pages, as we have, in hypernumbers you start to get a feel for the magnitude of the platform – especially if you compare it to Excel or Google Docs scalability capabilities.

Last thoughts. If a non-techie can build a transactional bug tracker system with collaboration mechanisms, what else could they build free from any dependency on techies!!!

**Give it a try.....What have you got to lose?......It’s free to try.**
