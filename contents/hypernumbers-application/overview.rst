Overview

If you’ve ever used spreadsheets in your organisation as an issues tracker (e.g. bugs, processes, projects, etc.) or list manager (e.g. sales, events, products, prospects, risk registry etc., etc.) you’ll no doubt be aware of the challenges and shortcomings of the spreadsheet ‘solution’. 

In the case of all such spreadsheet application solutions (e.g. a bug tracker), clear challenges arise:

* protecting data in general while letting many people add bugs and only some key personnel to update and edit certain bug fields 
* incorporating a mechanism that allows developers, testers and possibly customers to collaborate in the resolution process
* maintaining a bug’s fix and testing history for long term analysis
* maintaining a real-time centralised uptodate view of bugs and resolutions for all involved parties 

An issues tracker, and particularly a bug tracker, is fundamentally software to manage a social process (as illustrated below)  that involves collaboration between developers, testers and oftentimes customers.

Desktop spreadsheets don’t work well for these sorts of shared list management activities, because they lack natural collaboration tools and oftentimes depends on management by email. If you’ve tried using desktop spreadsheets you’ll know that, even in small teams, this ‘solution’ quickly breaks down. 

And even existing web-based spreadsheet solution, such as Google Docs, have these problems. You can't create a threaded conversation between multiple developers, testers, and business managers over specific bugs. You can't easily (if at all) create role based access to different data fields.
