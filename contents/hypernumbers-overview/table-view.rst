Table View
==========


The ``table`` view is useful for displaying spreadsheet pages that contain tables or lists - of row and column data.

It is similar to the sort and filter view in Excel and provides much the same capability. You can:

*	Sort on one or more columns
*	Apply default sorting
*	Apply multi-column filtering of rows
*       Hide columns
*	Use the line editor to edit the contents of a row.
