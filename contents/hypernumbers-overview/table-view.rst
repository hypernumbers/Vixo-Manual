Table View

The ``table`` view is useful for displaying spreadsheet pages that contain tables or lists - of row and column data.

The table view is particularly good with forms.

It is similar to the sort and filter view in Excel and provides much the same capability. You can:

*	Sort on one or more columns
*	Apply default sorting
*	Apply multi-column filtering of rows
*       Hide columns
*	Use the line editor to edit the contents of a row.

The row editor allows easy editing of rows:

The filter/display dialog box lets you manage the table view easily:
