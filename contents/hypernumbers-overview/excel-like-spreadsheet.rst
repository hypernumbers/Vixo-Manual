Excel-like-Spreadsheet
----------------------

Hypernumbers spreadsheet pages look like your desktop spreadsheets and operate like a desktop spreadsheet, as shown below.

Familiar features and capabilities include:

* you enter numbers and text into cells in the grid
* cells have an address e.g. the relative address ``A1``

   * Or absolute (``$A$1``), row absolute (``$A1``) or column absolute (``A$1``)
* cell ranges can be referenced e.g. ``A1:A10`` (relative) or ``$A$1:$A$10`` (absolute)
* you can enter functions and formulae e.g.

   * ``=D3-D4``
   * ``=(C7*D7)/E5``
   * ``=SUM(E6:E10)``
   * ``=VLOOKUP(2, A1:D12, 3)``
* you can create graphs
* you can resize column widths and row heights
* you can merge and unmerge cell ranges
* you can insert and delete rows and columns
* there is a formula bar in which to edit the contents of a cell or a formula
* there is a formula wizard that helps you quickly build functions without having to memorise a function's syntax
* there is a toolbar icon menu providing a quick way to change the layout and format of cells e.g.

   * apply formats to cell contents
   * change fonts and size
   * change the colour and background of cell contents
   * make contents bold or italic
   * change the alignment of cell contents
* you can have multiple pages opened at the same time as tabs and can move between them by clicking the tab
* you can access a further menu of features by right-clicking your mouse

So, if you already use a spreadsheet, such as Microsoft Excel, the grid layout will be very familiar and the way in which you build up (program) your spreadsheet page should be relatively straightforward.

To extend the spreadsheet paradigm for the web and enable non-specialist programmers to be able to build business applications, hypernumbers incorporates a number of additional features and capabilities.
