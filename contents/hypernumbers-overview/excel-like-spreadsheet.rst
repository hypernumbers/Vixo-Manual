Some of these familiar features and capabilities include:  

*	you enter numbers and text into cells in the grid
*	cells have an address e.g. the relative address ``A1``

	*	Or absolute (``$A$1``), row absolute (``$A1``) or column absolute (``A$1``)
*	cell ranges can be referenced e.g. ``A1:A10`` (relative) or ``$A$1:$A$10`` (absolute)
*	you can enter functions and formulae e.g.  

	*	``=D3-D4``
	*	``=(C7*D7)/E5``
	*	``=SUM(E6:E10)``
	*	``=VLOOKUP(2, A1:D12, 3)``   
*	you can resize column widths and row heights
*	you can merge and unmerge cell ranges
*	you can insert and delete rows and columns   
*	there is a formula bar in which to edit the contents of a cell or a formula
*	there is a formula wizard that helps you build functions   
*	there is a toolbar icon menu providing a quick way to change the layout and format of cells e.g. 

	*	apply formats to cell contents  
	*	change fonts and size  
	*	change the colour and background of cell contents   
	*	make contents bold or italic   
	*	apply strikethrough 
	*	apply word wrap
	*	change the alignment of cell contents
	*	etc..   
*	you can have multiple pages opened at the same time as tabs and can move between them by clicking the tab
*	you can access a further menu of features by right-clicking your mouse

So, if you already use a spreadsheet, such as Microsoft Excel, the grid layout will be very familiar and the way in which you build up your spreadsheet page should be relatively straightforward.

To extend the spreadsheet paradigm for the web and enable non-specialist programmers to be able to build business applications, hypernumbers has some additional features and capabilities. 

Some of these differences are introduced briefly below and will be covered in more detail in later sections of this book.
