Making Forms
------------

It is a trivial task to add webforms to a hypernumbers page. Forms are created in the spreadsheet view and used to collect information via the webpage or wikipage views. There are two types of forms you can create:

* appending form
* wikiform

The appending form sticks the data straight into a table-formatted spreadsheet with columns of data and headers. You can then use the table view analyse and explore the submitted responses. Wikiforms are used to capture data into cells in a specific spreadsheet and are often used in conjuction with templates.

You can build a form in the spreadsheet view by using the toolbar form icons to add form controls to cells on the spreadsheet.

A faster way is to highlight a range of cells and use the ``right-click`` menu (illustrated in the excel-like-spreadsheet diagram) to access the ``create forms`` option. A basic form is added to cells in the selected range. You can then change form elements and layout as required.

The example below shows an appending type webform as it appears in the spreadsheet and webpage views.

An example of a wikiform as it appears in the ``spreadsheet``, ``wikipage`` and ``webpage`` views is shown below:

There are five sorts of wiki controls

* a plain editable cell
* a drop down
* a rich-text entry
* a checkbox
* a decrementor/incrementor

Then can be added from the toolbar using the wiki icons:

The rich-text entry produces a cell that pops as a rich text editor - as you can see in the image below - clicking on the rich text cell turns it into a rich text editor.

The checkbox entry gives you a checkbox which can be toggled between the values ``true`` and ``false``. It looks like this on the wiki page:

The incrementor/decrementor lets you increase or a decrease a value by a fixed increment and appears like this on the wiki page:

Sometimes you have spreadsheet cells that you don't want to appear on wiki or web pages. You can hide them by *ghosting* them out - simply select the cells and use the ghost button on the toolbar.
