Making Forms
------------

It is a trivial task to add webforms to a hypernumbers page. These forms can be used on both webpages and wikipages. They stick the data straight into a table-formatted spreadsheet with columns of data and headers that you can sort.

You can add a form to a page by building up the form bit-by-bit using the icons on the toolbar. A faster way is to highlight a range of cells and use the ``right-click`` menu (illustrated in the excel-like-spreadsheet diagram) to access the ``create forms`` option. A basic form is added to cells in the selected range. You can then change form elements and layout as required.
