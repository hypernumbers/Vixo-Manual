=========

Templates are preformatted pages that can be saved to act as a model or standard page in an application. They are essential application building blocks in situations where many instances of the templated page will be needed to capture data in a consistent way that doesnâ€™t mess up any calculation or business logic associated with the particular type of page. 

Example templates might include:

*	Invoices and timesheets
*	Budgets and other financial model
*	Calculators  
*	Etc. etc.

In hypernumbers template pages inherit all the security features (user access and operations) that have been applied to the page the template is modelled on. They can thus be restricted to certain types of users and be set up to only capture data in specific cells.
