Web and Wikipages
=================

One of the key features of hypernumbers is the ability to present a spreadsheet page as different user interfaces (UIs) to end-users. There are four different views of a hypernumbers page that can be presented:

*	spreadsheet view
*	webpage view
*	wikipage view
*	table view

The spreadsheet view is the default setting. It is the programming layer for building hypernumbers applications. It is where content, layout, functions, business logic etc. is entered (programmed) into cells on the grid.

The webpage and wikipage views both look like web pages with one key difference. The webpage looks like a normal web page. The wikipage allows for special input fields (called inline wiki elements) to be editable so that users can input data directly into a cell on the underlying spreadsheet. The wikipage provides an easy but highly effective solution for implementing cell level security for the spreadsheet. It is used to restrict end users data entry to specific cells while locking down changes to other critical cells on the spreadsheet page.

Importantly, the webpage and wikipage views are **layout-equivalent** to the spreadsheet view. They present the contents and input cells programmed into the spreadsheet in an identical layout on the web. You design your web page layout in the spreadsheet view and that is how it will appear in the webpage and wikipage views.

Switching to one of these views from the spreadsheet view is a one-click action using the views menu on the right of the toolbar as shown:

Switching between views when not on the spreadsheet is a one-click action done via the hypernumbers tab â€“ visible in the top right are of the screen:
