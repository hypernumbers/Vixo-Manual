Managing Your Application
-------------------------

The site menu - on the toolbar - provides site and page administration capabilities that allow you to build up your application. It allows the programmer (i.e. the spreadsheet expert) to:
•	Navigate through the spreadsheet page structure
•	Open existing pages as spreadsheet views      
•	Create new and delete existing spreadsheet pages  
•	Save a hypernumbers page as a template with a particular view type
•	Create new pages using a saved template
•	Import desktop spreadsheets into hypernumbers
•	Change user’s sign-on passwords
