Hypernumbers Overview
=============

Hypernumbers is a web technology that enables spreadsheet users to build web applications. No specialist programming expertise is required. Most of what you need to know to get started is what you already know from using your desktop spreadsheet. Hence our mantra:

.. centered:: *if you can use a spreadsheet, you can build applications using hypernumbers*

In this introductory overview we will cover features of the spreadsheet that should already be familiar and briefly look at special features that are unique to hypernumbers. Special hypernumbers features will be covered in more detail in later sections of this book.
