Hypernumbers is more than just another spreadsheet clone. Hypernumbers is a platform that combines the functionality of the desktop spreadsheet with advanced features such as views, permissions and special web functions that together open up opportunities for spreadsheet experts/business professional to start to build sophisticated  secure web applications.

This democratizes the previously closed world of building software for the web, from IT professionals to non-IT professionals:

*	The web programmer is the spreadsheet expert who might be a subject-matter expert in some non-IT related business discipline
*	The programming layer is the spreadsheet
*	The end-user presentation layer can be configured any one of a number of views other than the spreadsheet
*	Each presentation view controls and prevents what users can do (aka damage) to the underlying spreadsheet
