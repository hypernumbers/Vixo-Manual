Integrating With WordPress
==========================

Hypernumbers and WordPress go together like Word and Excel. It is trivial to integrate Hypernumbers with WordPress and there is a `dedicated website`_ for it.

The Hypernumbers WordPress plugin called `embed charts, graphs, tables and forms with Hypernumbers`_ is used to embed things into WordPress.

There are a number of tutorials.

Insert Spreadsheets Into WordPress
----------------------------------

You can now easily `insert google and excel compatible spreadsheets directly into WordPress`_ - when the user changes them they automatically update without need to be republished in any way.

Charts And Graphs In WordPress
------------------------------

Simply drop `graphs and charts into WordPress`_. When the underlying data is edited the graph or chart automatically updates.

Creating And Inserting Tables In WordPress
------------------------------------------

Tabular data is very common. You can now easily `create and insert tables into WordPress`_ which the end user can sort or filter on your site.

Embeddable Forms For WordPress
------------------------------

The Hypernumbers spreadsheet lets you create `simple WordPress forms`_ that store information in an online spreadsheet and email you when someone submits data - making your life easier.

Calculators And Quotation Engines For WordPress

Specialist `quotation engines and calculators for Wordpress`_ are a cinch with Hypernumbers - they can be built easily in a spreadsheet and then published into your blog.
